# Welcome to My Tu Verras
***

## Task
The task here was to analyze Boston housing data and make general 
predictions using linear regression. 

## Description
The problem was solved by loading, analyzing, and visualizing the 
data using pandas and matplotlib. Finally, the LinearRegression 
class of sklearn was used to fit a linear model for the median 
home value as a function of the average number of rooms per dwelling. 

## Installation
The program requires Jupyter Notebook functionality with sklearn, numpy, 
pandas, and matplotlib. 

## Usage
To execute the program, first download the data via the command 

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/qwasar-public/track-ds/boston.csv

Then open the my_tu_verras.ipynb Jupyter notebook and run all cells.
